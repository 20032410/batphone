Serval Mesh
-----------

Serval Mesh is an app for [Android 2.2 “Froyo”][] and above.  It provides free,
secure phone-to-phone voice calling, SMS and file sharing over WiFi, without
the need for a SIM card or a commercial mobile telephone carrier.  In other
words, it lets your Android phone communicate with other Android phones running
Serval Mesh within WiFi range.

The latest release of Serval Mesh is available for download on [Google Play][].

Serval Mesh is [free software][] produced by the [Serval Project][] and many
[contributors][].  The Java/XML source code of Serval Mesh is licensed to the
public under the [GNU General Public License version 3][GPL3].  The
[serval-dna][] component of Serval Mesh is licensed to the public under the

Warnings
--------

Serval Mesh is **EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE**.  It has not yet reached version 1.0,
and is intended for demonstration purposes only.  It may not work as
advertised, it may lose or corrupt messages and files that it carries, it may
consume a lot of space, speed and battery, and it may crash unexpectedly.

Serval Mesh requires [root permission][] on your Android phone in order to put
its WiFi into [AdHoc mode][].  It can function without root permission, but
will be limited to using an existing WiFi home network or hot spot, and may
not work altogether.

Serval Mesh telephony is a "best effort" service, primarily intended for when
conventional telephony is not possible or cost effective, and MUST NOT BE
RELIED UPON for emergencies in place of carrier-grade communications systems.
The Serval Project cannot be held responsible for any performance or
non-performance of the technologies that they provide in good will, and if you
use these technologies you must agree to indemnify the Serval Project from any
such claims.
